# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
The fourth project assignment of the Odin Project's Foundations Course

The aim of this assignment was to create a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch tool. The script would create a grid of squaresof user-defined granularity and change the colour of squares individually when the mouse passes over them.

This piece of work showcases my skills using JavaScript.
